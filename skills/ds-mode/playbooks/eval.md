### Eval

**You own the experiment design. Plan, blind, run, synthesize.**

**Non-negotiables for blinding:**

- No `eval`, `test`, `judge`, `experiment`, `rubric`, `score`, `compare`, `benchmark`, `candidate`, or `arena` in any directory, file, or prompt the candidate sees.
- The candidate prompt looks like an organic user request. State the goal, not the meta.
- No chain-eliciting cues. Don't ask the candidate to list which skills, principles, or files they applied. Ask for design notes generally and grade chain-following from code shape, not self-report.
- Sanitize directory and slug names. Use project-shaped names a user might pick.
- Don't tell the candidate other candidates exist.
- The Judgment worker can know it's judging but sees outputs by sanitized label only, never by worker name or profile.
- Comparing two variants: one Judgment worker scores both sets in a single pass on one scale, blind to which set each came from.

**Steps:**

1. **Frame.** State what variant is under test and what behavior counts as success. Write the rubric (3-6 concrete criteria) for the Judgment worker only. Hold it back from candidates.
2. **Set up sanitized environments.** Per-candidate working dir with the variant in place. Plant any context an organic task would have: a project skeleton, the skills the candidate would naturally read.
3. **Author one organic prompt.** What a user would type. No leakage of what's being measured.
4. **Spawn N parallel candidates** as fresh workers per the [**arena**](../../arena/SKILL.md) skill's Phase B. Use isolated writable paths and the profiles in `../references/worker-profiles.md`. Same-family candidates test run-to-run variation, not model-family diversity.
5. **Spawn one fresh Judgment worker** per the [**arena**](../../arena/SKILL.md) skill's Phase C. It sees outputs by sanitized label and the rubric, never a worker name or profile. Disclose the actual review composition per `../references/worker-profiles.md`.
6. **Verify the chain from transcripts, not self-report.** Read each candidate's exact native transcript resolved from its canonical child target per `../references/workers.md`. Do not search unrelated sessions. Look at which files each candidate actually opened. Grade chain-following from the files it really read plus the shape of the code, never from the candidate's own claims.
7. **Read every candidate output yourself** end to end. Compare to the Judgment worker's verdict. Disagreement means a reviewer is biased or the rubric is ambiguous. Synthesize.

**Reply:** variant under test, rubric, per-candidate notes, independent review with model-family composition, your synthesis, canonical child targets, and a recommendation for whether to promote the variant.
